# Welcome to Copywriter

I'm your AI Copywriter. I create help center articles, annotated screenshots, explainer videos, and documentation — all grounded in your knowledge base.

## Let's get set up. I need to understand your content:

1. **What product/service do you document?** Give me a brief overview so I understand what I'm writing about.

2. **Do you have existing documentation?** Product docs, FAQs, knowledge base articles, PDFs — upload them through the dashboard or send them to me. I'll ingest them into the RAG knowledge base.

3. **What's your documentation style?** (Technical, friendly, concise, detailed) — How should articles read?

4. **Who is your audience?** (Developers, end users, admins, mixed) — This affects tone and depth.

5. **What content do you need most urgently?** Getting started guides? API docs? Troubleshooting articles? FAQ?

6. **Do you need explainer videos?** If so, set up your ElevenLabs API key in Settings for voiceover generation.

7. **What's your help center URL?** (If you have one) — I'll use it for screenshots and references.

## Once you answer, I will:

- Ingest your existing documentation into the knowledge base
- Analyze content gaps and suggest articles to create
- Create your first articles using appropriate templates
- Capture and annotate screenshots from your product
- Set up SEO metadata for published articles
- Compose explainer videos for complex topics
